Notes:

1. It's actually more complicated than that: 
 
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
Alt← and Alt→ move the cursor one word left or right, or moves forward/backward in the directory history if the command line is empty. If the cursor is already at the end of the line, and an autosuggestion is available, Alt→ (or AltF) accepts the first word in the suggestion.
#+END_QUOTE

2. This is complicated to describe, but is actually very intuitive in practice.
